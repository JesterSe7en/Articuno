# Weather API üå¶Ô∏è

**Weather API** is a simple web server built in Go that fetches weather data from the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) and presents it in a user-friendly HTML format. The server allows users to query weather data by city or ZIP code (USA only) and implements caching with Redis to optimize repeated queries.

This project is a demonstration of backend development skills, API integration, caching mechanisms, and the ability to create simple, effective web applications.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **API Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data using the Visual Crossing Weather API.
- **Web Server in Go**: Uses Go's `net/http` package to handle incoming requests and serve HTML.
- **Form Handling**: Allows users to input their city or ZIP code, with data validation.
- **Redis Caching**: Implements Redis to cache weather data for previously queried locations, improving performance and minimizing redundant API calls.

## Features üåü

1. **Real-Time Weather Data**: 
   - Queries weather data for a given city or ZIP code from [Visual Crossing's API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).
   - Displays temperature, conditions, and other essential weather details in a simple, clean HTML page.

2. **User-Friendly Form**:
   - Accepts city or ZIP code input from the user to search for weather data.
   - Data validation ensures that only valid inputs are processed.

3. **Efficient Caching with Redis**:
   - Redis is used to cache responses for repeated queries by the same city or ZIP code, improving performance.
   - Caching helps avoid redundant API calls, reducing response times and API costs.

4. **Scalability**: 
   - The project can be easily extended to add more features such as additional weather data, support for international locations, or integration with other third-party services.

## Tech Stack üíª

- **Go**: Backend web server using the standard `net/http` library to handle routing and form submissions.
- **Redis**: Caching layer to store and quickly retrieve weather data for repeated queries.
- **HTML**: Simple HTML form for user input and data presentation.
- **Visual Crossing Weather API**: Provides real-time weather data for various locations.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather_api.git
   cd weather_api
2. **Set up environment variables**:  Make sure to set the `WEATHER_API_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` environment variables.
   ```bash
   export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
   ```
3. **Install Redis (if not installed already)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install redis-server
   ```
4. **Run Redis**:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```
5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   go build -o weather_api main.go
   ```
6. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   ./weather_api
   ```
7. **Access the web application**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the weather form.

## Usage üìù

1. **Input a city name or ZIP code**: Navigate to the web page and enter either a city name or a ZIP code in the form.

2. **View the weather data**: The server will fetch the data from the Visual Crossing API (or Redis if cached) and display it on the HTML page.

3. **Redis Cache**: If the city or ZIP code has been queried recently, the response will come from Redis to minimize API calls.

## Why This Project? ü§î

This project was built to showcase backend engineering skills, especially in:

    - **API Integration**: Efficiently consuming and processing third-party APIs.
    - **Web Development in Go**: Building a fast, lightweight web server.
    - **Caching & Optimization**: Implementing Redis for real-world optimization.
    - **Handling User Input**: Validating and processing user input in a web application.
    - **Scalability**: Structuring code to allow for future enhancements and more robust services.
